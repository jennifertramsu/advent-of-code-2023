# Advent of Code 2023

## Reflections

- Day 1: Learned about `lookahead` assertions in REGEX
  - `(?=...)` positive lookahead - matches if ... matches next, but doesn't consume any of the string
- Day 5: Python doesn't do tail recursion optimization...???
- Day 8: Learned about `itertools.cycle` but also should've thought to verify if cycle length was constant (reason why LCM works)
- Day 9: Resist the urge to curve fit everything Jen...
- Day 10: Learned about Pick's theorem and the Shoelace theorem (also Python supports switch statements now! yay)
